# Login and Registration Page

This is a simple web application that provides login and registration functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to create an account and then log in using their credentials. The user data is stored in the browser's local storage for demonstration purposes, but in a real-world application, you would use server-side storage and secure authentication mechanisms.

## Features

- User-friendly login and registration forms.
- Basic client-side authentication using local storage.
- Separate external CSS and JavaScript files for better organization.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Rizwank123/goldilocks/UserAuth.git


    Open the index.html file in your web browser.

    Use the registration form to create a new account by providing a username and password.

    Use the login form to log in with the newly created account or use existing credentials.

Files

    index.html: The main HTML file containing both the login and registration forms.
    styles.css: External CSS file for styling the pages.
    script.js: External JavaScript file for handling form submission and authentication.

Customization

You can customize the styling and behavior of the login and registration forms by modifying the styles.css and script.js files to fit your project's requirements.
Security Considerations

This example uses client-side authentication with local storage, which is not secure for production use. In a real-world application, it's essential to implement server-side authentication and secure password hashing to ensure user data security.
